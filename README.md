# Mathematics

Hey and welcome! Here is a basic website about maths and did in WIDE training context. Note that this website is in french.
We had to create a website from scratch about a topic of our choice. We can choose to code with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JS/jQuery or use WordPress, I preferred to code with HTML,SCSS and JS. I also used the Mathjax librairy to displpay more beautiful math formulae. 

Note that this website is just the frontend part, there is no backend part.
