# Mathematic

Hey and welcome! Here is a basic website about maths and did in WIDE training context. 
We had to create a website from scratch about a topic of our choice. We can choose to code with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JS/jQuery or use WordPress, I preferred to code with HTML,SCSS and JS. I also used the Mathjax librairy to displpay more beautiful math formulae. 

Note that this website is just the frontend part, there is no backend part.

Want to see how does it look ?
